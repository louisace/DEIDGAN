 Diverse versions results with DEIDGAN by varying the input

## Introduction

In this repository, we propose an approach, termed as DEIDGAN, for face anonymization. Our approach consists of two steps. First, we anonymize the input face to obfuscate its original identity. Then, we use our designed de-identification generator to synthesize an anonymized face.
